List of tasks that need to be completed before the EFIS is flight-worthy

- Add debouncing circuit to button board
- Add pullup resistor to ADS1118 CS line
- Add pullup resistor to thermocouple inputs to prevent floating while unconnected
- Remove R3 and R4
- Remove tach input voltage divider and replace with series 1k
- Change Vref on EGT sensor


List of tasks that would be nice but not necessary

- Flip LCD connector to align with LCD board.
- Move serial to port 1 for better arduino compatability
- Add FPC screen interconnect
- Replace crystal with larger form factor for ease of assembly
- Remove extra pad on reset button
- Make tach circuit compatible with open-collector sensors (Lycoming)
- Move transistor from underneath DSUB
